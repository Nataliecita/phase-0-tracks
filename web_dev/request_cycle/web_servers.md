#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
*they assume that the user of their operating system would be a computer literate from the start. The entire Unix (which the linux philosophy is derived from) philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing. 
* "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things"
* It never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you to do anything you tell it to. Whether it is unintentionally bad or not.
* Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power.
* linux does not handhold
* treat all users with respect

#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
