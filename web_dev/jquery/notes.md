- 3 and 4 of that series


*How often to stop and test what I learned
- Read and try as I go. For the videos try watching at a faster speed and if its not too much code, code along

*Breaks? If so, how often
- 2 breaks:
    + at 45 min
    + 30 after that

*Plan of approach
- Read the jquery basics from jqfundamentals first to get a better idea and then go to the the first 4 videos. W3 after and then documentations. Maybe see JS vanilla vs jQuery


*Why this plan?
-I'm a visual person, but it's nice to mix the too styles, and learn,try as I absorb info.


##notes
- Objects
    -As it turns out, most everything we work with in JavaScript is an object in fact, there are only five kinds of values that are not objects:

    -strings (text)
    -booleans (true/false)
    -numbers
    -undefined
    -null
    -These values are called primitives, but even some of these values can be treated as though they were objects â€” more on that in a minute. But what's an object? Let's look at an example of a simple object:

-there are only five values in JavaScript that are falsy:

    -undefined (the default value of declared variables that are not assigned a value)
    null
    -NaN ("not a number")
    -0 (the number zero)
    -'' (an empty string)


##jQuery
- Get some elements
The simplest thing we can do with jQuery is get some elements and do something with them. If you understand CSS selectors, getting some elements is very straightforward: you simply pass the appropriate selector to $().
    - It's important to understand that any selection you make will only contain elements that existed in the page when you made the selection. That is, if you write var anchors = $( 'a' ); and then add another <a> element to your page later, then your anchors variable will not contain that new element.

-Stopped at creating new elements


##for after
* https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/
* understand a feature of JavaScript known as hoisting.
* .call() vs .apply() on MDN docs
