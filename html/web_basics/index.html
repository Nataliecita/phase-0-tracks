<h1> Hallo Welt</h1>
<p> So aside from learning how to code, I would like to learn <em> German.</em> </p>

<p> Around March I will find out if I will be going to Germany on a fellowship.<strong> That would be epic. </strong> I am incredibly interested in the German language and culture. </p> 

<h2>Some of the places I would like to visit are: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Cologne</li>
    <li> Munich</li>
    <li> Hamburg</li>
    <li> Nuremberg</li>
    <li> TÃ¼bingen</li>
    <li> Essen</li>
  </ul>

<h2> Activities I look forward to doing </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Rollerblading through the town or city </li>
    <li> Trying out as many breads as possible(Germany has over 600 different types)</li>
    <li> Hike or walk in <a href= http://www.berchtesgadener-land.com/en/home>Berchtesgaden</a> </li>
    <li> Talking to locals about the upcoming Bundestag election</li>
    <li> Visit my city's/town's Weihnachtsmarkt </li>

  </ol>
