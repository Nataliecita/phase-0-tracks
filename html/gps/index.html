<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to keep everything organized in an HTML page. Each section serves a purpose. I find the nav bar and main to be the most useful. The nav bar allows you to navigate between the pages while main has the main content of that page. It has whatever makes the page unique to the rest.

The browser displays elements on a page from top to bottom. It goes line by line. 

I was amazed with the creation of a snippet. I never really thought about that and how you could create that. I learned some of the CS concepts with C, and we learned how to create our own functions, therefore it makes perfect sense that you can create snippets. I think eventually I'll create a more handy snippet, I am not quite sure what it will be, the more I code and continue to building a certain thing over and over again, I will get a better idea. 

I am still learning the difference between certain HTML elements. I need to make sure that my HTML foundation is strong/stable, and I find myself looking up things more often than not. For example, differences between sections and articles, and some styling (my indentation isn't great). The more I continue to read articles and build things/validate them, the more I'll understand my mistakes. 

Overall I found this challenge to be extremely helpful. I can't wait to create my very own snippet! -->
